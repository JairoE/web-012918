# The Browser
* What is it?
  * The HTML you write?
  * The page source?
  * The Elements tab in Dev Tools?
* How does JavaScript work in the browser?
  * Browser code
  * JavaScript engine
  * JavaScript standard library
  * Browser APIs
  * Your code!
* DOM (Document Object Model)
  * A tree structure starting at the document
  * Every element is a node in the tree
  * Every element is related in this structure to every other element
  * We can find elements by traversing the DOM
  * Each element has a parent (except one) and children (maybe)
  * Elements have properties that can be manipulated
  * `window` object
  * `document` object
* Templating
  * We used to use ERB
  * Now we'll write templates for dynamically updating our web page without refreshing
